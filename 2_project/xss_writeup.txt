Mixed content is content from an HTTPS website that includes HTTP content. Because of this, the entirety of the page might not be completely secure and contains only partially encrypted content. Most modern, well-maintained browsers block these kind of sites due to compromised security. Those settings can be turned off, however, for example by following the instructions in the lab manual.  

A purely psychological way of circumventing mixed content blockers for attackers might be to exploit the fact that web users tend to ignore warnings or pop-ups. For instance, if an attacker sends a malicious URL to unsuspecting victims, they could include some harmless remark in the e-mail stating that "some browsers may have problems rendering the page", in the hopes that victims blindly click it and infer that the block warnings are simply a rendering issue by the browser.
