# Question 1

1. Based on the ranges of values for reserved IP addresses for private networks (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses), the devices connected to the local network have the following MAC and IP addresses, respectively: 
00:26:08:e5:66:07, 10.0.2.1 
04:0c:ce:d8:0f:fa, 10.0.2.2
8c:a9:82:50:f0:a6, 10.0.2.3

# Question 2

2. Based on the number of connected devices, and the traffic generated by them (making a handful of requests to popular websites), it appears that the network is some kind of LAN, possibly a home-owned one. 

# Question 3

3a. Using Wireshark's Resolve Network (IP) Address setting, the associated DNS hostname to 194.109.21.66 is dl.xs4all.nl. 

3b. One distinct difference between active and passive FTP is that active FTP makes use of the PORT command (conversely passive FTP uses PASV). Seeing as packet 16546 contains "PORT", we assume that active FTP is used here.  

3c. One apparent vulnerability of the captured packets is that both the user's username and password are transferred seemingly unencrypted (although the traced password was incorrect), making it trivial for an adversary to gain access to the victim's account. 

3d. All of FTP over SSH (SFTP), FTP over SSL (FTPS), and SSH offer more secure file transfer protocols than regular FTP. 

# Question 4

4a. By filtering out every packet not sent or received over TCP port 443 (reserved for HTTPS), we get a handful of different sites. For instance, youtube.com is among these. 

4b. There is not. The domain name is required to establish a connection before the TLS handshake takes place, therefore it will be visible to potential eavesdroppers. 

4c. Based on the course material, the list of supported cipher suites will be issued at the "client hello"-stage. Investigating the contents of such a packet yields a total of 36 crypto suites:
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc00a)
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (0xc014)
Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA (0x0088)

Cipher Suite: SSL_RSA_FIPS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA (0xfeff)
Cipher Suite: TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA (0x000a)

4d. Some of these cipher suites use cryptographic algorithms which have been cracked and are provably insecure nowadays. Examples of these include TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA and TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5.

4e. The server decides to use the following cipher suite: 
Cipher Suite: TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA (0xc011)

# Question 5

5a. Once the user has logged in successfully, all subsequent GET requests are done over HTTP.

5b. Since data over HTTP is not encrypted, a man in the middle can intercept traffic in plaintext and modify that to their needs to impersonate the victim.

5c. Modern, well-supported browsers clearly display whether or not a website uses HTTPS. Informing users about the distinction between HTTP and HTTPS, and how to spot which sites use which protocol is advised. 

5d. The user began the Facebook session by logging in. What followed was a series of search queries narrowing down to a user by the name of Zakir Durum/Zakir Durumeric from the University of Iowa. They later go to Zakir's profile timeline and opens the message composer to Zakir. An attachment is uploaded (POSTed)in the message composer as well. They later viewed the user's notifications.
